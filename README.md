# Language-detection
This is a small project that my group and I carried out in our second year studying Machine Learning at the Information Technology University. The purpose of this project is to detect the language used in a given text.

The training data was collected from 20 different languages on Wikipedia. Each text was collected and preprocessed before being labeled with its corresponding language. There were approximately 1,000 samples collected for each language, and all were compiled into a CSV file.

The Machine Learning models used in this project include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The models were compared based on two metrics: F1 score and Accuracy score. Both metrics show that the Naive Bayes model achieved the best.
